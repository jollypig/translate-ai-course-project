# Translate Movie AI (course project)

The final project for the Building AI course that should help to determine idea of movie (anime, cartoons) translation to some specific language. It's quite a common problem to find translation (voice or even subtitles) to the movie to some of the small speech communities language like belarusian or latvian language. And even though I know several common speaking languages sometimes I want to see the movie I like with my native language. Or watch some rare movie with my children for whom it's hard to read so fast. I guess this is the common problem all over the world.


## Summary

My project should at least define some steps to automatizate the movie translation process. And then it should help implement (I hope) some instruments to do that process. 


## Background

Good translation need a lot of time and human resources to accomplish the goal. I know that AI may help to simplify or even replace some of the people (ideally). Time to time I do translation by myself using various tools (editing small portions of subtitles). The last time I did the translation of the movie I used some of the free AI translation web sites and even with its limitations the result was excellent. So my next idea was - is it possible to do the same thing for other movies with different languages. 

When I become more familiar with the present AI capabilities I wrote down a few problems that may help to implement my idea now or in the near future:
* Get the text representation of the dialogs (subtitles) with some extra information: voice, intonation, volume, etc (a lot of movies has subtitles that can be used as basis);
* Do translation to the selected language, the result (subtitles) can be used already as alternative translation;
* Voice the text representation with the right intonation, etc - it is possible now for some languages.

Some related problems that comes from the above:
* Voice recognition which is not ideal for such a project now;
* Voice adjusment - now there are several types of human voices available.


## Data sources and AI methods
The start point may be the existing original subtitles and the subtitles with translation. There is a huge database of such kind of subtitles but they have very different quality.

AI methods that may help: voice recognition, deep fakes (to imitate voice).


## How is it used?
There is no process defined.

## Challenges

The main limitation here is the author rights.

## What next?

ChatGPT mostly cover all the AI methods that this project requires. But there are another AI developers that provide similar tools. Before starting the project there need an investigation in this field.
